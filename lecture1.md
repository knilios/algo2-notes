# First lecture [love] [love] [skull]

We only study about algorithms, not data structure.

## Grading criteria
1. 20% quiz + homework
2. 40% midterm
3. 40% final

## Main textbook
1. Algorithm Design by Jon Kleinberg and Eva Tardos. - This is more fun :) to read (?)
2. Just use something else lmao

# Algorithm (what will we be studying)
- Basic knowledge (Proof, Big O)
- Greedy
- Divide and conquer
- Dynamic Programming
- Network Flow
- NP Completeness
- Linear computing (just a fancy opiton)

# Revising
## Time complexity
Big O blah blah blah, fast blah blah blah, time vs input size blah blah blah. Read the algorithm 1 notes.

## CPU speed 
The frequency indicates how much data can you send or compute in the same amount of time.

## Big-O notation [Upper Bound]
It's time complexity. But it's the maximum time the program could take.

## Proofing stuffs
$ Q -> P $ or $ ~P -> ~Q $

That's all I got bro [sad] [skull] [love] [love] [skull]
