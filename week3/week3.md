# Greedy algorithm
## Idea
Pick the 'best' choice at any moment

# Dynamic programming
## Idea
We use an answer from the smaller sub-problem to solve the bigger problem

## Proof of greedy
1. Greedy always stay ahead - we have to prove that the greedy algorithm always stay ahead
2. Exchange argument

### Internal scheduling problem
There are n tasks/course
so it's already been taught in the first course of algorithm

## Idea2 greedy stays ahead

## Scheduling to minimize lateness
How can you calculate 

ex. you have to perform all tasks with the minimum lateness

finishing time: $f_i$ = time that task-i is finished

$late_i$ = f_{i}-d_{i}$ if fi>di , o if fi<=di
